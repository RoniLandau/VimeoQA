Why are you shooting 24p with 1/1000 shutter? I would think that the high shutter speed would defeat any aesthetic advantages of 24p (which ideally should be shot at 1/48). If you want to maintain a film-like frame rate, just shoot in 30p and you won't have to deal with pulldown removal.
Also, check out Vimeo's FAQ for encoding HD footage:
vimeo.com/help/hd#hd_encoding
CWildenradt13 years ago
I am using Premiere Pro CS3. I'm using the Adobe Media Encoder to export files to wmv. That's the only difference between what I'm doing and what the FAQ states (the FAQ says to use Quicktime Pro). IMHO, the wmv format looks better than the mov format when using Premiere. All other settings match the FAQ though.
I have to say that of the 3 videos I have here, this is the only one where I noticed a considerable degradation. Maybe it's just because the file size is larger?
Lance WattsPRO13 years ago
What program are you exporting from and what are you using to encode?
By the way, these kids are 10x better than me when I was five.
CWildenradt13 years ago
I just wanted to try it out. I actually liked it a lot. I have experimented with various shutter speeds in 24p mode and have found several of them to produce unique and favorable aesthetic qualities. I don't like to confine myself to conventional wisdom. :)
On the other hand, I'm not the biggest fan of 30p--just a personal taste. I like it for some specific applications, but that's about it.
Regarding the FAQ, I followed it exactly.

You seem like the kind of person that has trouble following directions. Not a bad thing, if you know where you're going. Unfortunately, you appear lost.
It doesn't matter if your settings match the Vimeo FAQ because you're encoding with the wrong application, using the wrong codec and encoding to the wrong format. For best results, use Quicktime (as the FAQ directs) and encode with H.264.
CWildenradt13 years ago
Haha, not exactly.
Firstly, as I mentioned I don't have/use Quicktime Pro. I have/use Premiere Pro. When using THAT encoder on MY video footage, the h.264 Quicktime codec produces an inferior result in comparison to the Windows Media 9 codec. This is derived from an A/B comparison, 5,000kbps rate, 1280x720, etc., etc. I certainly wouldn't want my source file to look worse just because Vimeo's FAQ recommended to use the h.264 codec. In a perfect world where everyone owned the same software, everyone could use the exact recommendations on every website and be happy. But I think you'll agree that we're not dealing with those variables in reality and there are indeed more than a few ways to skin a cat. I
realize that the comments section of my video is not the place to debate technical nuances, but I just want to relay the details of where I'm coming from.
Secondly, as I mentioned I have two other videos uploaded, using the EXACT same encoding technique mind you, that did not suffer anywhere near the visible
quality loss that this one did. Therefore a more accurate assessment would be that I SEEM like a person that is curious about the inconsistency of these video results after Vimeo's conversion process.

I think the comments section is a perfectly reasonable place to discuss technical nuances. And if you'd like to achieve more consistent results on Vimeo, simply download Quicktime. You have to encode to a smaller size for upload anyway, so why not create a second source file with Quicktime?

Have you tried using the SUPER encoder? it's free and you can do batch files. I'm actually beginning to prefer that over QT Pro. I'll be able to give a better comparison once I actually film some stuff with my new HV30

I haven't actually, but thanks for the tip. I'll give it a shot.

I think the footage looks great! Experimentation is a wonderful thing.

actually fast shutter techniques is one of the most used in horror movies and action scenes, just see the first scene of 28 weeks later and you'll know what i mean.
although it doesnt work for slow motion stuff, as you can see in this video, when you speed down a little bit its looks jerky and slow motion it should be smooth.
but if you wanna have that crazy exhilarating frantic kind of shots, fast shutter is your perfect call.
